        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish consisting of stacked layers of pasta,
        fillings, and cheese. Common fillings include meat sauce (ragù),
        vegetables, and béchamel sauce. Popular recipes often include ground
        meats, sausage, and various cheeses. The dish is baked until bubbly and
        can serve a large number of people.
